{"url": "https://clios.com/entry-information/judging-process/", "page_type": "entry_info", "content": "Judging Process Judging Process Judging Process Each year, Clio appoints top creatives and marketers from around the world to serve on our distinct juries. Clio selects individuals whose own creative work epitomizes the best of their respective fields, ensuring that each juror has an in-depth understanding of the industry’s evolving marketplace. Why You Should Enter Judging Process FAQs The Clio judging process is known for its diplomatic approach to recognizing creative excellence. All jurors have an equal say in decisions, and the majority vote rules. Judging criteria across all programs is creativity. Some of the questions jurors are asked to think about include: Is this work bold? Innovative? Inspiring? Am I jealous of this work? Do I wish I had done it? How is this work propelling the industry forward? What do I want to signal to the industry by awarding this work? Juries will review all of the entries submitted within their assigned medium types. They participate in preliminary rounds of judging individually followed by a final round of judging to determine the awards given to each piece – Gold, Silver, Bronze, Shortlist. During the judging process there is no minimum or maximum number of statues that need to be awarded. The jury reserves the right to award as many or as few entries as they see fit in a particular medium or category. This ensures that the work is not judged against each other, but simply by its own merit. Abstaining Jurors that have submitted work into a medium they are judging abstain from voting on that work in all judging rounds. Code of Conduct Each of our jurors engage with the process as a service to the larger creative community. As part of this service, we ask each juror to be guided by two main principles of conduct in addition to our judging criteria and protocol: Impartiality – Jurors are obligated to remain unbiased in the judging process and abstain from showing preference to work submitted by entrants in their personal or professional network. Diligence – Jurors are required to ensure that all entries are judged fairly, considered equally, reviewed in their entirety and critiqued solely based on the information provided. Grand Clio The Grand Clio is Clio’s highest honor. The Grand Clio is similar to “Best in Show” but it’s more than just that. It represents work that is considered head and shoulders above all other entries in a particular medium for that year.

{"url": "https://clios.com/entry-information/frequently-asked-questions/", "page_type": "entry_info", "content": "Frequently Asked Questions Frequently Asked Questions Frequently Asked Questions See below for common questions asked by our entrants, jurors and clients. Why You Should Enter Judging Process FAQs Entering Work What information do I need to start entering a piece of work? The basic information that you will be asked to enter when submitting your Clio entry is: Entry Title – The entry title is a short name for this entry. Keep it short, memorable, and descriptive. We suggest you not include the brand name, agency name, or medium type as these will be on your entry in other areas and don’t need to be duplicated. Entry Brand – The entry brand is the brand, organization, individual or cause the entry is advertising. First Launch Date – The date that the work first launched in public. Country of Origin – The country in which the work was first released to the market. Synopsis (optional) – The main objective of the entry, written as concisely as possible. Please include any additional context needed; including cultural background, insights on the creative process and/or specific notes on what makes the entry unique in the medium entered. Though a synopsis is optional, it is highly encouraged. English Language Translation – We ask that you dub or subtitle your non-English language videos into English. If this is not an option, please provide a text-based English translation. Entrant Company Credit – This credit is important because it not only displays who is entering the work, but should your piece be awarded, this company credit will appear on the trophy. Note: In addition to this basic information all entries require a Cover Image (JPG). The image will be used as the thumbnail during judging, as well as on our Winners Gallery and potentially on our social channels. This image should represent the brand/product being marketed. Other required information varies per Clio program and medium. As a friendly reminder, per Clio policy, all entries must remain anonymous to jurors, therefore, please remove the following from your entry: agency credits, individual credits, logos and/or slates. Please keep any and all credits within the Credits portion of your entry. Is there a time limit for case study videos? No, there is no time limit for videos. We recommend keeping all case study videos under 3 minutes for judging purposes. For more information on media requirements please visit our Clio Resources Page and select the desired Clio program. How long should my entry synopsis be? Although there is no minimum or maximum number of words, we recommend you keep your synopsis to approximately 300 words. We suggest you utilize this section of your entry to elaborate on the piece as well as the creativity of your idea. It’s helpful to cater your synopsis to the selected medium/category, and is also a great place to provide any helpful context, including cultural context. I've already entered my work into one of the Clio programs, can I enter it into other Clio programs as well? Yes, as long as you meet the entry requirements for a given program you are allowed to enter your work into it. (ex. A piece previously entered into Clio Sports may be entered into the Clio Awards so long as it meets the eligibility dates.) However, you are not allowed to enter work into the same program that was already submitted in a previous year for consideration. The Creative Effectiveness Medium is the only exception to the above. Please see the General Eligibility requirements listed for each program for more details. Clio Awards Clio Sports Clio Entertainment Clio Music Clio Health Are spec ads eligible for entry? Spec ads and director’s cuts are NOT eligible. All professional entries must have been created for a paying client except pro bono work for charities and non-profit organizations. What’s the difference between a single entry and a campaign entry? How do I submit a campaign entry? Campaign entries consist of 2 or more executions that are part of a series in the same medium. Each execution within a campaign requires a title and individually uploaded media within the Executions tab on the entry form. Single entry fees and Campaign entry fees differ and slightly increase with each deadline; See “Entry Fees” on the desired Clio program for details. How to Enter a Campaign Entry Campaign entries consist of 2 or more executions that are part of a series in the same medium. Each execution within a campaign requires a title and individually uploaded media within the Executions tab on the entry form. How to Enter a Campaign Select a medium to create a new entry. Complete the required Basic Info fields (Entry Title, Entry Brand, Cover Image). Select “Campaign Entry” under the “Campaign or Single Entry” field. Confirm you would like to “Change Campaign Status” by selecting “Yes, Change”. (If this is an entry you had been working on as a single entry, any media you uploaded on the Media tab of your submission will be added to your first execution in the Executions Tab) Fill out the required information on the Additional Information tab (Country of Origin, First Launch Date, etc.) Once on the Executions tab, you’ll see the title of your campaign entry at the top. Campaigns consist of two or more executions that are part of a series in the same medium and category. A Campaign that is mixed consists of two or more executions that are part of a series in the same medium but different categories. Give each execution a title that is short and descriptive, and add media as appropriate. To add additional executions, click “Add Execution” until your entry is complete. Display Order: In this section, you may change the order the executions display in your campaign entry by clicking and dragging them to adjust. This will impact how the entry displays for jurors and in the Winners Gallery if your entry is awarded. If you change the display order, please be sure to select “Save Display Order”. It is in this area you may also delete an execution from your campaign if you wish to do so. After reviewing your entry summary, read the Terms & Conditions thoroughly and click “I agree to these conditions.” If no other required action is necessary, you can add this entry to your cart and check out. In the credits, do I need to list every single person or company that contributed to the work? While it is not required, we recommend that you are as comprehensive as possible when filling out the credit details with your entry. Should your work make the shortlist or win an award, the credits will show within the Winners gallery. For more information regarding Credits, see here . Can I make changes to credits after the final deadline? While we encourage you to be as thorough and accurate as possible when entering your credits information for entry, we realize this isn’t always possible. Credit updates are allowed after the entry has been submitted. To update credits on your entries from 2023 and beyond, please head to new-entries.clios.com and follow the instructions below: Log into your account Click on “Entries”, and then “Orders” Select “Edit Entry” to the desired entry Click on the “Credits” tab and add or remove credits as needed In order to view all of your credits or upload credits in larger batches, navigate to the Credit Library tab at the top of the screen Note: Credits can only be edited in the Credit Library if they are not attached to an existing entry.

The entry fees are determined by the date you successfully submit your work into the program, not when you begin working on an entry.

The ceremony is set to take place at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on Thursday, Nov. 13. Originally established by The Hollywood Reporter in 1971, Clio Entertainment is “one of five verticals developed by the Clios to champion boundary-pushing marketing, advertising and communications that shape popular culture across film, television, streaming, live entertainment and gaming.” Leaders in the entertainment industry determine which entries win the Grand, Gold, Silver and Bronze Clio Entertainment Awards. Clio Entertainment has paired Bloom, the Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning creator and star of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, with famed photographer Sally Montana to create key art for this year’s awards. The photo shoot aims to build on the marketing campaign from Rhubarb, the creative agency behind this year’s Clio Entertainment Awards graphics. The direction of the show, according to organizers, was “Caravaggio meets comedy.” The playful design is intended to hint at the humor and unexpected moments planned for this year’s Clio Entertainment Awards.

He has been one of the most prominent figures in music and pop culture alike, performing for hundreds of thousands of fans with Usher & Ludacris, Afrojack, Steve Aoki, Pitbull, TLC (on FOX’s American Idol), Becky G, Offset, LMFAO, Too $hort and E-40 just to name a few. Hitting it’s 10-year anniversary this year – back in 2014 – Lil Jon proved once again he’s a powerhouse artist teaming up with DJ Snake for their smash hit “Turn Down For What,” which created a massive worldwide craze. Most recently, Lil Jon was the musical director for Usher’s 2024 Super Bowl halftime show in Las Vegas, where he performed their iconic record, “Yeah!,” which has garnered over a billion-streams on Spotify. In February of 2024, Lil Jon announced and released the first of his meditation albums called Total Manifestation, which was unexpected by fans, and met with resounding success. He followed-up that album with his second one titled Manifest Abundance. The second mediation album was released in conjunction with wellness brand, Natural Vitality, with an album release event in Bel Air, CA that included a Lil Jon-lead mediation session and Q&A. Summer of this year closed-out with Lil Jon performing a complete surprise performance at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago to help the Georgia delegation officially nominate VP Kamala Harris for the Presidency of the United States, forever creating the new blueprint of what a Roll Call nomination will look like moving forward in the United States. Lil Jon continues to be a master at marketing and business being tapped by Peloton to co-lead a mediation class as well as Alex Toussaint’s famous ‘Club Bangers’ class in June of this year. In addition, Jon’s company – Soul Chakra – teamed up with Peloton to create a capsule collection of merchandise exclusive to Peloton. Jon has also been tapped by Pepsi for their Super Bowl commercial (which also featured Cardi B and Steve Carell), Hotels.com for their new commercial featuring Captain Obvious, and Jimmy John’s for the rollout of their new Little John sandwich. Kool Aid and Lil Jon collabed in 2018 for their viral Christmas campaign with the Kool Aid Man, Bud Light [Fall 2015] to star in their #UpForWhatever commercial and campaign. For many years he’s has a business relationship with Don Julio tequila as a brand ambassador, with a 2020 campaign that’s both a Postmates and Don Julio partnership for Lil Jon Party Packs which were rolled-out. He’s had an Oakley endorsement deal, partnered with SOL headphones – which helped to launch SOL Deck by starring in the Radio Shack commercial in Fall 2013. His success as a mainstay in the DJ-world is evident with a current residency at Hakkasan Nightclub (MGM Grand) along with Jewel Nightclub at Aria Resort & Casino. Previously, Lil Jon had a DJ residency for over five years at the Wynn/Encore (Surrender, Tryst, XS); even being named the Las Vegas Resident DJ of The Year. He has traveled the globe DJing worldwide in places such as, but not limited to France, Germany, South Korea, China, India, Dubai, London, Mexico and Australia. His marketing chops came in helpful when casted on NBC’s primetime show Celebrity Apprentice (Spring 2011) quickly becoming a fan-favorite nationwide. Lil Jon was back on primetime television in the Spring of 2013 on the cast of Celebrity Apprentice All-Stars, where he came in 3rd and raised almost $200,000 for the American Diabetes Association. His philanthropic work hasn’t stopped there; Lil Jon has built 2 schools in Ghana with Pencils of Promise, and was honored at their 2019 Gala in New York City for all his contributions towards the organization with the Visionary Award. Known best for his role in creating and popularizing the southern movement and lifestyle known as Crunk, Lil Jon delivered a string of regional hits (in the 90’s) with the East Side Boyz eventually becoming a national force in 2001 thanks to the tracks “Bia Bia” and “Put Yo Hood Up.” Their iconic albums include We Still Crunk!, Put Yo Hood Up, Kings of Crunk and Crunk Juice. Jon helped popularized the word ‘Crunk’ not only on a national scale, but worldwide, so much so that The Merriam-Webster Dictionary added the word into their book in 2007. Paying homage to the fact that he became a fixture in American pop culture, comedian Dave Chappelle created entire skits on the legendary Chappelle’s Show based on Lil Jon’s personality and sayings. Lil Jon has a long list of platinum-selling productions, crafting groundbreaking hits for a diverse array of artists such as E-40, Usher, Ciara, The Ying Yang Twins, Ice Cube and more. He’s also worked with will.i.am, Miley Cyrus, Britney Spears, Bret Michaels, Travis Barker, Jennifer Lopez, Machine Gun Kelly, DJ Snake and many more. As an artist, he has sold millions of records as the frontman of Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz, whose smash hits “Get Low” and “What U Gon’ Do” have been among some of the biggest crossover hip-hop records. His songs have been featured in huge blockbuster movies and television shows including The Hangover, Girls Trip, Neighbors 1 & 2, The Proposal, the Step Up franchise, FOX’s So You Think You Can Dance, Ballers, Logan, Black-Ish, HBO’s Ballers, SNL digital short, Horrible Bosses, NBC’s Parks & Recreation, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and many more. Many TV shows have featured Lil Jon as a guest with his massive presence such as The Ellen Degeneres Show, The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Late Night with Seth Meyers, The Today Show, Good Morning America, Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live, Talk Soup, E!’s Fashion Police, Extra!, Access Hollywood, Talking Dead (AMC), MTV’s Ridiculousness, VH1 Hip Hop Squares, Lights Out with David Spade (Comedy Central), and much more. His consistent hitmaking has earned him legions of fans from Los Angeles to New York to the Midwest and of course his native region, the South. This is no more evident as Lil Jon has won 2 BMI Songwriter of the Year awards as well as scored eleven Billboard Awards (for the two hit Usher tracks “Yeah!” and “Lovers and Friends”), a Grammy, a Radio Music Award, a BET award, two MTV Video Music Awards, and an American Music Award. http://liljon.com/ https://www.facebook.com/LilJon https://www.twitter.com/LilJon http://instagram.com/LilJon http://soundcloud.com/lil_jon https://www.tiktok.com/@liljon", "content_length": 6673}

Given a makeshift prosthetic leg patched together from leather belts and masking tape, she never stepped outside of the orphanage before being adopted by an American couple from Michigan in 1995. Still learning the English language, Bassett joined sports as a way to connect with her peers. She tried basketball, softball, golf, and tennis before competitively racing in track & field and triathlons. At 14, she was introduced to the Challenged Athletes Foundation (CAF), which gave her a grant to fund her training while also allowing her to attend running clinics and mentor young amputees. She worked her way to qualify for her first U.S. Paralympic Team in 2016. In pursuit of her Paralympic dreams, Scout competed at the 2012 U.S. Paralympic Track and Field London Trials, where she placed 2nd in the 200m and 3rd in the 100m. Scout is a 7-time National Champion in the 100m. She is currently the World Record holder in the 400m and America’s Record holder in the 200m. Before competing in track, Scout was on the USA Paratriathlon National Team, where she won 3 silver medals and 1 bronze medal at the ITU Paratriathlon World Championships. Off the track, Bassett is the Women’s Sports Foundation Board President, a member of the Gatorade Women’s Advisory Board, and co-host of BBC Sport’s acclaimed podcast On The Podium. She was recently honored as one of Refinery29’s ‘Powerhouses of 2024’ and was also featured in season 2 of The Greatness Code on AppleTV+, which debuted in May 2022. Bassett spends time as a mentor, activist for people with disabilities, athlete ambassador, and motivational speaker, and is a unique and inspiring role model for all people to dream big and believe. Bassett’s book, LUCKY GIRL, was released in September 2023 alongside the launch of the Scout Bassett Fund, which offers financial grants to young athletes with disabilities to support the extensive cost of competing at the elite level.", "content_length": 2326}

Starting out in 1986 as Craig Murray Productions (CMP), the trailer company was initially known for its one-of-a-kind, 24/7 exclusivity partnership with Disney Studios. Through the years, Craig shepherded his firm’s unprecedented growth, eventually evolving into MOCEAN, now the entertainment industry’s largest independently owned creative agency. As Executive Chairman at MOCEAN, Craig leads a passionate team of 180+ creative, strategy, design and finishing specialists delivering integrated campaigns and original content production for many of the biggest movie, television, streaming, gaming, sports and consumer brands. STARTING OUT CMP’s iconic early campaigns include The Lion King, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, The Color of Money, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Good Morning Vietnam, Aladdin, Dead Poets Society, Toy Story, Monsters, Inc., The Santa Clause and Finding Nemo, among many others. In 1996, determined to broaden his agency’s scope beyond family films, Craig became the first Hollywood agency owner to open a satellite office–CMP/West–to handle edgier movie and TV titles geared towards teens and older audiences. Out of this groundbreaking move came multiple Key Art Award–winning campaigns ranging from Star Trek: Insurrection, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and Napoleon Dynamite. BUILDING A NEW BRAND In 2000, Murray expanded on his vision with the launch of MOCEAN. Beyond notable achievements such as 8 Mile, Snatch, and Shape of Water, MOCEAN has also created trailer and tv campaigns for many of Marvel’s all-time biggest blockbusters, including all three Avengers and all three Guardians of the Galaxy titles plus, most recently, Deadpool & Wolverine. MOCEAN has shot and produced original Clio-winning campaigns for God of War Ragnarök and PlayStation Playmakers video game launches, Larry David’s Curb Your Enthusiasm, Netflix’s Cabinet of Curiosities, and FX’s American Horror Story and continued their decades-long Disney/Pixar collaboration with the massive box office openings for Wall-E, Up, Finding Dory, and Inside Out 2. Additionally, Craig was a founding partner of Picture Head, now the world’s largest post-production and finishing facility for entertainment marketing campaigns. HELPING OTHERS With a passion for mentoring and nurturing young talent, Craig began the trailer industry’s longest-running paid student internship program in 1990, providing scores of students nationwide with hands-on training and a pathway to a career in entertainment. He and MOCEAN are staunch supporters of numerous social-minded LA nonprofits, including Chrysalis, A Place Called Home, Film2Future, Soapbox Women and School on Wheels. And, as a strong advocate for arts education, Craig has served as booster president of Burbank High’s nationally acclaimed vocal music program and is a past co-chair of the Burbank Arts for All Foundation. ACCOLADES A 1976 advertising graduate of Michigan State University (MSU), Craig received the MSU Distinguished Alumni Award in 2010. He is a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences and has served on the boards of Chrysalis in Los Angeles, the MSU College of Music National Leadership Council and the MSU Athletics Director Advisory Board. The new Murray Hall and Murray Family Terrace at Michigan State are named in honor of Craig and his family. And, in addition to the hundreds of awards the agency has earned through the years, MOCEAN was dubbed “Entertainment Agency of the Year” three times since 2015 and one of the “Best Places to Work for Innovators” by Fast Company in 2023. PERSONAL Craig is a born-and-bred Midwesterner, growing up in the blue-collar Detroit suburb of Mt. Clemens, Michigan. Following creative stints at Walt Disney World in Orlando and BBDO in Atlanta, Craig moved to Burbank in 1980 to become Creator Director/Copy at Disney Studios. Today, he still resides in Burbank with his “superstar” wife, Lisa–as do their three “fabulous” daughters, Jessie, Courtney and Becca, plus two “terrific” sons-in-law and three “extra, extra, extra special” young grandkids.", "content_length": 4391}

The secrets to his success could be characterized as having an uncanny instinct for creative brilliance; the courage and influential power to bring his vision to life with clarity and purpose; and the ability to build, unite and unleash strong teams as a multiplier of that vision. Tim has spent the last 19 years as a client-side marketer and worked over 16 years as an agency leader. The quality and breakthrough nature of his work has been consistent, spanning a multitude of industries in the US and abroad. This success of this body of work is undeniably linked to Tim’s personal influence and oversight. Even in his early years on the agency side, working for firms such as Goodby, Silverstein and Partners, Tim was always someone who the creative teams and clients alike wanted in the room. His core assignments at GS&P included the breakthrough Norwegian Cruise Line campaign, “It’s different Out Here,” and the highly acclaimed work on Alaska Airlines. Tim left GS&P and the U.S. to work for international agencies in Europe. He felt most international work was watered down and lackluster, and he wanted the opportunity to drive innovative and creative marketing programs across multiple markets and cultures. During his 12-year tenure on the agency and client side, he earned the reputation for delivering strong business results through bold marketing programs that resonated in diverse cultures around the world. While at Y&R Stockholm, he managed Ericsson mobile phone handsets across 42 countries in EMEA as they grew to become the #1 handset provider throughout the region. At Publicis, he led the European launch for Virgin’s new pan-European airline. He then was recruited to become a partner at Scandinavia’s most successful agency, Forsman and Bodenfors and contributed to some of the most distinctive and awarded campaigns in the world for brands such as Ikea, Volvo and Telia. Tim’s clients brought him close into their most inner circles so that he could guide them to help crack their most complex challenges. He was a driving force in helping the agency achieve global status that attracted major international clients both inside and outside Scandinavia. Volvo Global was his biggest client at Forsman and Bodenfors, and the company recruited him to lead their marketing communications across Europe and ultimately the world. His first assignment as a client was their biggest pan-European launch in decades for the S40. The launch campaign directed by Spike Jonze, “The Mystery of Dalaro,” is still seen as one of the most bold, innovative and successful marketing efforts in the history of the company. It has become a textbook example of unconventional marketing that early in 2003 invested in digital as a mass media vehicle. His second campaign, “Life on Board,” won the Titanium for the most forward-thinking campaign at the Cannes Lions festival. During his tenure at Volvo, he helped fuel significant gains in market share and lifted perceptions of the carmaker to successfully position it as a modern luxury brand. This work attracted VW of America, and Tim agreed to return to the U.S. and lead their marketing efforts during a time when VW opened a new US-based plant. Tim launched their first car from the plant with a Super Bowl spot that’s still considered one of the most iconic pieces of work of all time – “The Force.” More importantly, its launch before the Super Bowl on YouTube was both bold and unconventional at the time. TIME magazine wrote an article about the spot, entitled “The Ad That Changed Super Bowl Commercials Forever.” Additionally, VW was chosen as Global Advertiser of the Year at the Cannes Lions Creativity Festival. Tim left VW to lead global marketing for Activision. His vision was to build franchises such as Call of Duty into global mainstream powerhouses. He wanted to take gaming out of the basement, broaden its appeal and customer base, and invest in the marketing technology and processes necessary to enable year-around monetization through microtransactions. Within months of joining the company as CMO, he brought in a new agency 72andSunny and launched Modern Warfare 3 with the campaign, “Vet and Noob,” which won the Grand Effie for the most effective campaign in the industry. It was not only the biggest gaming launch ever, but also was the biggest entertainment launch ever, surpassing Avatar. During his 7-year tenure, Tim was recognized as an Adweek Brand Genius and built a strong integrated marketing machine that not only delivered the highest selling game of the year every year he was there, but also helped turn their business model into an engagement model that significantly decreased churn and dramatically increased revenue. Tim was then recruited as the NFL CMO in 2018 at a critical time for the NFL. With a courageous mindset and expansive marketing skillset, Tim cultivated the NFL into a sports league making major strides to be more human and compassionate, with its finger on the pulse of societal issues that resonate most with its fans. These strategies have directly resulted in a tangible resurgence of the NFL brand, with the perception of the league and players reaching an all-time high and viewership of NFL games dominating the media ecosystem. Tim’s first major campaign was the Super Bowl spot, “The 100-Year Game,” which brought together over 60 past and current players to celebrate the NFL’s 100-year anniversary. It was #1 on the USA Today Admeter. This was the first expression of Tim’s “helmets off strategy” that aimed to humanize the players and league, providing a more authentic, emotional expression for the brand. Since that time, the NFL has launched a series of campaigns that not only celebrate the joy of the game, but also leverage the league’s influence as a force for good. With Tim at the Marketing helm, the NFL has been willing to engage in complex, tough conversations on racism, show contrition for past mistakes, and leverage its strength and power to unite its fanbase of 218 million. Furthermore, Tim uses his role in the NFL to bring different leagues together. During the pandemic in 2020, he led a multisport effort to recognize and celebrate first responders. For Mental Health Awareness Month in 2024, Tim led a cross-sports initiative with the Ad Council that brought together 11 sports leagues as part of the “Love, Your Mind” campaign, which was created to destigmatize the conversation around mental health and ensure millions of fans have access to the resources and tools needed to prioritize their mental wellbeing. Tim has also taken an interest in shaping the marketing and advertising industry into a force for good. He’s on the Board of Directors and an Executive Committee member for Ad Council, where his leadership role allows him to promote important public service announcements on behalf of various sponsors. As a member of the Adweek DEI Council, he works with other CMOs, brand officers, presidents and more to accelerate meaningful change in diversity, equity and inclusion across the industry. For several years, Tim has also been an Adweek Executive Mentor. Outside of work, Tim raises up the next generation through mentorship and philanthropy to do his personal part in driving positive change. He currently serves as a board member for Big Brother and Big Sisters of America, the nation’s largest donor and volunteer supported mentoring network.", "content_length": 7809}

A lyricist and composer who has won an Oscar Award, three Grammy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, an Ivor Novello International Award and earned induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, Williams’ timeless classics range from “We’ve Only Just Begun”, “You and Me Against the World” and “The Rainbow Connection” to “Touch” and “Beyond” on Daft Punk’s chart-topping Album of the Year, Random Access Memories on which he also performed, receiving a Grammy as Featured Artist. As President and Chairman of the Board of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), he is also a leading spokesman for music creators in the digital age. Williams’ standards have been recorded by such diverse musical icons as Ray Charles, David Bowie, Barbra Streisand, Tony Bennett, Diana Ross, The Carpenters, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Luther Vandross, Willie Nelson, Gonzo and Kermit The Frog. Although Williams is widely known as an actor in dozens of films and on television, it is his musical legacy that continues to inspire. His songs and scores have received six Oscar, nine Grammy, six Golden Globe and two Emmy nominations. “The Rainbow Connection,” from the children’s classic The Muppet Movie, has been added to the Library Of Congress’ National Recording Registry, a collection of “audio treasures worthy of preservation for all time based on their cultural, historical or aesthetic importance in the nation’s recorded sound heritage.” It is also one of two Williams’ songs that grace the American Film Institute’s List of Top Movie Songs of All Time; the second, “Evergreen,” is from the award-winning Barbra Streisand/ Kris Kristofferson remake of A Star Is Born. Additional song scores include the cult favorites Phantom of the Paradise and Ishtar, as well as The Muppet Christmas Carol, Bugsy Malone, and Emmet Otter’s Jugband Christmas, the latter of which has been adapted for the stage and opened to rave reviews. Paul also created the story and wrote the songs for Disney’s Emmy-nominated A Muppets Christmas: Letters To Santa and “I Wish I Could Be Santa Claus” was performed on the Estefan Family Christmas album. Williams’ collaboration with Gustavo Santaolalla has included the animated film, The Book of Life which received a World Soundtrack Award for their “Apology Song” and more recently, “If It’s To Be”, performed by Kali Uchis for Maya and The Three. They are currently working on a musical version of Pans Labyrinth with JJ Abrams and Guillermo del Toro. In addition to music creators’ rights, Paul is also passionate about recovery, and works tirelessly to destigmatize alcoholism and addiction. Sober 34 years, his humorous observations of life, love, and creativity, augmented by the education and knowledge he gained through his studies and certification from UCLA as a Certified Drug Rehabilitation Counselor, has been shared in a best-selling book co-written by Tracey Jackson, entitled Gratitude and Trust: Six Affirmations That Will Change Your Life which was featured on Oprah’s Super Soul Sunday. While publicly lauded for his work as a songwriter, author and actor, most recently for his role with Billy Bob Thornton in Goliath, Paul predicts he’ll be remembered for playing Little Enos in the Smokey and the Bandit trilogy and for his lyrics to “The Love Boat” theme. However, it is the lyrics from Bugsy Malone that aptly sum up his philosophy: “You give a little love and it all comes back to you; You’re gonna’ be remembered for the things that you say and do”. As a devoted husband to writer Mariana Williams and proud father, Paul considers his son Cole, and daughter Sarah, to be his best work.", "content_length": 3964}

Since those early 'inexpert' days Rob sharpened his skills, winning a bunch of awards, (including a Clio) and finally built his own agency, Rogers Riggs, which four years later he sold to Grey. He arrived on the shores of NYC in 2000 as Chief Creative Officer, Grey Healthcare, where his teams created thought provoking and register ringing campaigns for several blockbusters. Rejoining Sudler in 2003, he ran the Asia Pacific region for five years before returning to the US full-time as co-CEO, where he daily puts 'ideas first' to foster an environment of inspirational curiousity within the successful US business.

At four years old, Molly was diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa, a rare degenerative eye disease, causing eventual blindness. She began public speaking at the age of five to raise awareness for her community — not realizing this passion would one day become her career. Losing the majority of her vision at age fourteen, she faced harsh bullying and struggled with her mental health. Molly not only overcame these hardships, but she turned her pain into purpose— bringing her voice to speak at places like the United Nations and the World Economic Forum in Davos. Seeing the impact of her message, she decided to take her story to social media where there was a clear gap in representation. Molly helped pioneer a space for the disability community online, being the first blind content creator to hit one million followers on social media. Public speaking throughout her childhood, Molly began touring the world full time as a professional speaker when she was 18. Speaking to audiences as large as 20,000, Molly has spoken alongside fellow changemakers like Malala, Greta Thunberg, Justin Trudeau, Martin Luther King III, and Richard Branson. Her inspiring message is one of resilience and hope that has been heard by hundreds of thousands of people on stages across the globe. Beginning her social media journey as a viewer at 14, she always knew that she wanted to build a safe space online for people who didn’t feel heard or seen. It wouldn’t be until six years later that she found the confidence to post her first video to YouTube, and she has since gone on to collaborate with fellow creators like Charlie D’Amelio, Casey Neistat, the Dolan Twins, and Lilly Singh, to name a few. Many Fortune 500 companies, like Unilever, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Starbucks and P&G, turn to Molly to elevate brand awareness and create fun and engaging content featuring their products. Molly’s audience comes to her platforms for their daily dose of honesty and enlightenment. Growing up dreaming of being a model but recognizing the exclusive nature of the industry, Molly’s dreams were first realized when she appeared as the global face of Dove, as both a print and commercial model. She has since gone on to appear in an Oscars commercial for Samsung, be a “Real Role Model” for Aerie by American Eagle, and walk in LA Fashion Week for Tommy Hilfiger Adaptive. While the mainstream media and fashion industry has been slow to embrace diversity and inclusion, Molly is determined to move the industry forward. Named to Allure’s A List in 2022 as one of 19 individuals who are driving and shaping the future of beauty, Molly has since worked with beauty brands from Estée Lauder, to No7 and Too Faced. Molly is frequently interviewed by national and international press including the Wall Street Journal, Allure, People, Elle, Success and Forbes in addition to broadcast appearances on shows including NBC Today, Fox Business, NPR and CBC. In 2022 Molly appeared on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, a longtime fan of Molly’s work, followed by an appearance on the Rachael Ray Show in January 2023. In 2019, Molly’s debut book “It’s Not What it Looks Like” was released on Audible. Molly chose to release the book in an audio only format to flip the script on the way that books are traditionally consumed. Growing up as an avid reader with limited audiobook options, Molly wanted to force readers to have a similar experience by only giving the audio option, inviting people into the world of how she reads. This creates an intimate experience between the listener and Molly as she narrates short stories from her life experiences. This NY Times best selling audio journey will make listeners laugh, cry, and learn. One thing is true throughout all of Molly's work– she is a passionate advocate and ally for minority communities. Whether it's through consulting on accessibility for companies like Meta and Google, or through helping government agencies create better policies and legislation for the rights of service dog users, Molly is a strong force pushing the needle forward to true diversity and inclusion. Molly can provide great insights on industries ranging from fashion, beauty and marketing to technology and media. Molly Burke leads from a place of authenticity and vulnerability — a relatable approach that balances wit and sass with knowledgeable empathy. Her work bridges gaps in society and gives a voice to historically underrepresented communities. Molly’s impact has empowered people to accept, overcome, and create change.", "content_length": 4798}

She spent three years at “Seiniger U” learning from the best in the business. She is eternally grateful to Tony for taking a chance on her right after her graduation from Otis/Parsons in 1985, where she earned a BFA in Communication Design and Illustration. Dawn is also the founder of BLT Helps, a nonprofit agency created to help other charities with their marketing and design needs.

{"url": "https://clios.com/specialty-oty-awards/clio-entertainment/2013/hans-zimmer/", "page_type": "winners", "content": "Hans Zimmer - Specialty Awards 2013 Hans Zimmer Back to Specialty Awards Clio Entertainment 2013 Honorary Award Hans Zimmer Share: Hans Zimmer has scored over 100 films, grossing more than 15 billion dollars at the box office worldwide. He has been honored with an Academy Award, two Golden Globes, and four Grammy’s. In 2003, the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers presented him the prestigious Henry Mancini award for Lifetime Achievement for his impressive and influential body of work. Hans’ interest in music began early, and after a move from Germany to the U.K., would lead to playing with and producing various bands, including The Buggles, whose “Video Killed the Radio Star” was the first music video to ever appear on MTV. But the world of film music was what Hans really wanted to be involved with. Not long after meeting established film composer Stanley Myers, the two founded the London-based Lillie Yard Recording Studios together, collaborating on such films as My Beautiful Laundrette. It was Hans’ solo work in 1988’s A World Apart, however, that gained the attention of director Barry Levinson, who then asked Hans to score Rain Man, Hans’ first American film. Levinson’s instinct was right – the score’s Oscar nomination that followed would be the first of nine. With Hans’ subsequent move to Hollywood, he expanded the range of genres of film music he explored, and his first venture into the world of animation, 1994’s The Lion King, brought Hans the Oscar. The Lion King’s soundtrack has sold over 15 million copies to date, and The Lion King Musical has gone on to win a Tony Award, and to become Broadway’s ninth-longest-running show in history. A number of scores for animated films have followed, including co-writing four Bryan Adams songs for Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, including the Golden Globe nominated “Here I Am.” Hans has also scored The Simpsons Movie, Kung Fu Panda and collaborated with will.i.am in Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa. Hans’ career has been marked by a unique ability to adeptly move between genres – between smaller films and comedies (such as Driving Miss Daisy, Peter Weir’s Green Card, Tony Scott’s True Romance, Ridley Scott’s Thelma and Louise, James L. Brooks’ As Good As It Gets, Nancy Meyers’ Something’s Gotta Give, and The Holiday) and big blockbusters (including Tony Scott’s Crimson Tide, John Woo’s Mission: Impossible 2, Ridley Scott’s Hannibal, Black Hawk Down, Edward Zwick’s The Last Samurai, Gore Verbinski’s The Pirates of the Caribbean series, Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins, and Ron Howard’s The Da Vinci Code). In the middle of Hans’ unparalleled pace of taking on new projects, his ability to innovate, to re-invent genres is what is perhaps most striking. The film scores Hans has done this for speak for themselves, whether it has been for drama in Barry Levinson’s Rain Man, action in Ridley Scott’s Black Rain, war in Terrence Malick’s The Thin Red Line, or most recently the dark comic book world of Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, for which he received another Grammy.

It was Hans’ unique take on the historical in Gladiator that earned him another Golden Globe. The album sold more than three million copies worldwide and spawned a second album “Gladiator: More Music from the Motion Picture.” Hans’ roots in performing never left him, and in 2000, Hans performed his film music live for the first time in a concert at the 27th annual Flanders International Film Festival in Ghent, Belgium. With a 100-piece orchestra and 100-piece choir, he performed a number of newly orchestrated concert versions of a selection of his work. The concert was recorded by Decca and released as a concert album entitled “The Wings of a Film: The Music of Hans Zimmer.” His background in collaboration and mentoring never left Hans either, and he created a Santa Monica based musical ‘think tank’, Remote Control Productions, in order to build a creative environment to nurture the talent of those new to the composing world. In the process, he has launched the careers of an unparalleled number of film and television composers, including John Powell (the Bourne Trilogy), Harry-Gregson Williams (Shrek, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason), Geoff Zanelli (Disturbia), Heitor Pereira (Curious George), Henry Jackman (Monsters vs. Aliens), James Dooley (Pushing Daisies), James Levine (Nip / Tuck, Damages), Ramin Djawadi (Iron Man), Rupert Gregson-Williams (Hotel Rwanda), Steve Jablonsky (Transformers), and Trevor Morris (The Tudors). Hans has received a total of 10 Golden Globe Nominations, 10 Grammy Nominations, and 9 Oscar Nominations, the most recent for Christopher Nolan’s Inception. His innovative and powerful score has been praised as the Best Score of 2010 by countless critics’ groups and has earned him BAFTA, Golden Globe, Grammy and Critics Choice Award nominations. His other Oscar nominations include Sherlock Holmes, Rain Man, Gladiator, The Lion King, As Good As It Gets, The Preacher’s Wife, The Thin Red Line and The Prince of Egypt. Hans has been honored with the prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award in Film Composition from the National Board of Review. He also received his Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in December 2010. Zimmer served as Music Director for the 84th Academy Awards in 2012. His recent films include Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel, The Dark Knight Rises, which marked his fourth collaboration with director Christopher Nolan, Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted, Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides directed by Rob Marshall, Kung Fu Panda 2, Gore Verbinski’s Rango, Megamind, How Do You Know, Nancy Meyers’ It’s Complicated, Kung Fu Panda, Madagascar 2, Frost / Nixon, The Dark Knight and Ron Howard’s Angels & Demons. Zimmer also scored the title sequence to the hit 2013 History miniseries The Bible, created by Mark Burnett. Zimmer’s upcoming films include The Lone Ranger, out July 2013, Rush, directed by Ron Howard and set for release in September 2013, and Steve McQueen’s Twelve Years A Slave, out in December 2013.", "content_length": 6594}

He has enjoyed creative relationships with many of the world’s greatest directors: George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Bob Zemeckis, Frank Darabont, Guillermo Del Toro. Drew’s journey began obscurely in Oregon City, Oregon, in 1947. Born the second of three children, the struggle for survival was never far off from this low-income family. After high school, Drew applied to Art Center College of Design to enhance his artistic skill and was accepted. Aided by a scholarship awarded during his third semester to foster his exceptional talent, Drew graduated Art Center with Great Distinction. Life after graduation was a slow struggle up the ladder of commercial success. Small jobs gradually led to the highly visible work of album covers. Perhaps the most famous of these are Black Sabbath’s “Sabbath Bloody Sabbath” and Alice Cooper’s “Welcome to My Nightmare.” When the billboard featuring the artwork from “Welcome to My Nightmare” hit Sunset Boulevard, it caught the eye of a Hollywood advertising agent. The golden age of Hollywood poster art came calling and Drew’s work began to glimmer at movie theaters everywhere. Drew’s key art for films such as STAR WARS, INDIANA JONES, BACK TO THE FUTURE, E. T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL, HOOK, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, HELLBOY, HARRY POTTER, THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER, POLICE ACADEMY, BLADE RUNNER, THE THING, FIRST BLOOD, BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, in all over 200 movie titles, became world renowned. Michael J. Fox noted in the documentary “Drew: The Man Behind the Poster,” that the poster is “the first notes of the piece … the beginning of the story.” Harrison Ford observed that Drew’s posters are “grand, but don’t lose the human scale.” For Drew, bringing his “magic,” as executives referred to his taste and style, was an opportunity to make art out of advertising. It proved successful worldwide. Drew’s artwork for the movies has been exhibited throughout the world, including a one-man show, “Drew: Art of the Cinema,” at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. The recent documentary film “Drew: The Man Behind the Poster” features interviews with many of the people with whom Drew has worked over his long and illustrious career. The documentary provides the backdrop of place Drew’s work hold’s in the cultural context of Hollywood.", "content_length": 2545}

Logging in grants access to Advanced Search and more Entry Details. Entrant Company Mutiny, A Trailer Park Company Program Clio Entertainment 2025 Industry Type Games Medium Experiential & Fan Engagement Category Fan Engagement Subcategory Social Media To launch Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, we needed to reach a new generation of gamers who weren’t engaging through traditional media—TV, OOH, digital, or even standard social feeds. This audience lives in chat threads, DMs, group texts, and on Discord—spaces where brands can’t typically reach. So, we had to find a way to not just show up, but to be part of the conversation itself. Activision was bringing back The Replacer—Call of Duty’s beloved stand-in character who handles your responsibilities so you can play—and our challenge was to inject him directly into the culture of social and digital conversations. We knew that more than ever, audiences are communicating in the language of GIFs—short, expressive, and instantly shareable reactions that speak louder than text. But, instead of just creating branded GIFs to sit alongside the rest, we found a way to make Call of Duty the punchline, the reaction, the reply. We embedded The Replacer directly into the way gamers talk to each other every day. But we didn’t just create branded GIFs. We partnered with GIPHY to do something never done before: replace GIPHY’s most popular and commonly used GIFs with custom versions starring The Replacer. Our goal was to “crash” players’ conversations organically—making it feel like The Replacer had truly shown up everywhere, even in your group chat. In a first-of-its-kind collaboration with GIPHY, we identified the top 12 reaction GIFs most used by gamers. Then we recreated them, frame by frame, with actor Peter Stormare as The Replacer. Every detail—from props and costumes to lighting and backdrops—was obsessively crafted, while injecting The Replacer’s signature humor. On launch day, GIPHY executed a platform-wide takeover. For 48 hours, when users searched for their favorite GIFs across iMessage, Reddit, Discord, Android, Slack, and more—they found The Replacer. The response was instant and explosive. With over 200 million impressions in just two days, the GIFs permeated message threads, comment sections, and private chats worldwide. Gamers felt in on the joke. And The Replacer, once again, handled everything—even internet culture itself—so you could play. This wasn’t just GIFs. It was Call of Duty crashing the conversation—exactly where gamers are today.

The innovative game reimagines interactive entertainment by turning sci-fi body-swapping into a real-time experience powered by cutting-edge AI allowing the audience to experience the central concept of the film by changing places with their friends on a video & audio streaming call. For each player, we generated AI models of their voice and face, then allowed them to puppet a realistic model of a random friend while answering a series of questions and attempting to deceive their audience about who was who. This blend of streaming video with an Augmented Reality overlay of one of their friends was designed to immerse audiences in the film’s narrative while showcasing Netflix’s ability to push creative boundaries through innovative storytelling. Combining advanced technology with engaging social gameplay, the experience amplified Netflix’s It’s What’s Inside while pushing the limits of AI in entertainment.

Entrant Company FCB Health New York, an IPG Health Company Program Clio Health 2025 Advertiser Category Health Awareness & Advocacy Medium Design Craft Category Art Direction This film is a crafted design that merges traditional methods with modern technology to elevate the overall artistry. Alcohol misuse claims 3 million lives globally each year, and in the U.S., the wintertime not only brings extreme cold, particularly in the North, but also tends to increase alcohol consumption, raising risks such as cirrhosis. Our campaign highlights that anyone in these conditions might face similar challenges, not just those already affected by alcohol misuse. Drawing inspiration from a scientific article on how climate affects drinking habits, we crafted the film around the metaphor \"snowball out of control,\" depicting the unpredictable increase in alcohol use and addiction as temperatures drop. The Snowball is the story of a man whose drinking habit snowballs out of control, set to “Everything I Have is Yours,” by Billie Holiday in our animation film, we endowed characters with emotions and personalities to make them feel real and relatable. We also used paper textures to symbolize our fragility in the face of alcohol. With the help of proprietary 2D Diffusion Render, we integrated hand-drawn artistry with AI-driven tools, crafting a unique and emotional visual style. For the sound, we preserved the original recording and enhanced it with an immersive Dolby Atmos 3D audio experience. Taking inspiration from the sonic textures of Billie's era, we utilized a Shure 730B microphone, also known as the \"Billie Holiday microphone and analog recording techniques. We enhanced authenticity using handcrafted foley sounds that range from the crackling of snow to subtle object shifts. Each element was meticulously created using wood, fabric, and snow, blending historical and modern soundscapes for a unique narrative. The narrative, guided by Billie Holiday's moving song, underscores the escalating consequences for the characters as their situation worsens each time the metaphorical snowball grows. We made use of weather data, to display the film on colder, shorter days when risks escalate, driving broad awareness and traffic to our website, TheSnowball.org. Adding depth to our narrative, we poignantly note that Billie Holiday succumbed to cirrhosis due to long-term alcohol misuse, emphasizing the urgency of our message. The animation film, perfectly integrated with the music, reflects this. ‘Everything I Have Is Yours’ symbolizes life being eroded by alcohol, warning that in winter, alcohol consumption can quickly snowball out of control.

THE TRIAL highlights how abortion bans are dragging women’s rights backward by crafting a narrative using real quotes from anti-abortion politicians and reproductive justice leaders. Styled as a Salem witch trial, the film reveals the eerie similarities between historical oppression and modern rhetoric. The production connects the past to the present with diverse casting, natural light, and desaturated tones, immersing viewers in the stark reality.

That made us think: What if we reminded the world how effective Dramamine is by saying goodbye to the industry we are accidentally killing? So we set out to pay tribute to a fellow icon of nausea with The Last Barf Bag, an entire campaign built around giving the barf bag a grand farewell. We launched with a documentary that explores every corner of the barf bag universe and premiered the film at a museum exhibit that literally put barf bags on a pedestal. We also designed an e-commerce platform that imagines a better future by selling repurposed bags for everything but barf—all to show people the impact and efficacy of Dramamine in an unexpected way.

That made us think: What if we reminded the world how effective Dramamine is by saying goodbye to the industry we are accidentally killing? So we set out to pay tribute to a fellow icon of nausea with The Last Barf Bag, an entire campaign built around giving the barf bag a grand farewell. We launched with a documentary that explores every corner of the barf bag universe and premiered the film at a museum exhibit that literally put barf bags on a pedestal. We also designed an e-commerce platform that imagines a better future by selling repurposed bags for everything but barf—all to show people the impact and efficacy of Dramamine in an unexpected way.

Entrant Company LePub Entry Type Product/Service Program Clio Awards 2025 Medium Type Professional Medium Creative Strategy Category Creative Strategy Being around for over 150 years and present in 192 countries makes Heineken one of the most popular beer brands in the world, but most importantly: the most misspelled beer brand in the world. With millions of people all over the planet constantly mistreating our brand by mispronouncing, misspelling, and misusing Heineken. And so when we found out that people think Heineken is German, that nobody can spell nor pronounce our name and basically they don't care about our brand, we soon realized that those were not setbacks but proof of the brand's widespread enjoyment across cultures. Afterall as our founder once said, we are in the business of good times. So instead of fighting these mistakes, we decided to celebrate them. Globally. And so for Heineken 150th anniversary, the brand decided to… not celebrate Heineken, but the way people enjoyed it. One way or another. And just like that, for a full year, we stopped being Heineken and started being Whateverken people wanted us to be, to have good times. Parties and events, tons of exclusive collabs with some of the most famous brands in the world (like... Adidas and Monopoly!), millions of bottles available all over the world, and lots of good times... and guess what? None of them spelled Heineken correctly. But who cares, we're in the good times business after all. All 2025 Winners Credits To see entry credits, create an account or log in .

It’s instant—you just feel it, and before you know it, you’re all in. That’s why, instead of making a campaign talking about the Latin vibe, we created one. Partnering with Grammy-winning producer Ovy on the Drums and breakout Latin star Micro TDH we produced, recorded, and released a reggaeton track and music video, launching it exactly like a music release. From early teaser drops to streaming platform rollouts, we put it out the way music is released. No ads, no slogans—just a track, a music video, and a vibe that speaks for itself.

This panel will explore the evolving role of music strategy in brand storytelling and how a cohesive, intentional approach to sound can define a brand just as distinctly as its logo or visual identity. Speakers: Jamie Glenn VP, Partnerships & Licensing Universal Production Music Zach Golden Creative Director Elias Audio Branding – Livestreaming Under the Influence…Of Brands Presented by Twitch Learn the balancing act of brand integration in livestreaming through hands-on experience. During this session led by Patrick Moses, the U.S. Creative Production Lead at Twitch Brand Partnership Studio, attendees will play branded games while exploring how creators navigate sponsored content without losing their authentic voice.

Speaker: Patrick Moses U.S. Creative Production Lead Twitch Brand Partnership Studio – The Clio Awards x Luma AI In Conversation With AI Challenge Powered by Dream Machine Finalists Presented by Luma AI As the lines between creativity and technology blur, a new generation of storytellers is leading the charge – harnessing AI not as a shortcut, but as an opportunity for bold and original thinking. This roundtable discussion features three finalists of the AI Challenge Powered by Dream Machine, a first-of-its-kind collaboration between The Clio Awards and Luma AI, inviting creatives to explore what’s possible when the power of AI meets the art of advertising. Through 10-second vertical ads built with Luma’s Dream Machine, finalists will reflect on their creative process, the challenges and surprises of working with generative tools, and how AI is shaping the future of content creation for a new era of advertisers and audiences. Speaker: Jon Finger Creative Workflow Executive for Dream Lab, Los Angeles – Why Taste is Strategy: The Aesthetics of Influence In an era where attention is fleeting and loyalty is hard-won, brands who are engaging influencers to develop a distinct and consistent aesthetic are rising above the noise. This conversation explores how cultivating “taste” through content creators, visual identity, and cultural fluency is more than a creative decision, it’s a strategic one. We’ll examine how an intentional aesthetic can deepen brand loyalty, signal values, and drive long-term engagement. We’ll also highlight the brands setting the standard, from beauty to lifestyle to food, that are proving just how powerful good taste can be.

Drawing on Getty Images’ unique research approach through their VisualGPS insights platform, powerful visual examples, and extensive client partnerships to identify gaps, Norman will illustrate how brands can leverage visual storytelling to more accurately reflect various underrepresented communities and position them as a driving force in shaping the cultural and creative landscape of tomorrow.

His most recent projects include hosting (and slaying fashion-wise) the global cultural phenomenon The Traitors, creating a solo dance theatre piece about the Scottish bard Robert Burns, lip-synching the protagonist in a documentary, and producing a podcast series about a sperm bank heist. He can be seen as Sigmund Freud in the film V13, as an elderly woman with a pet crab in the Disney kids series Robogobo, and heard in a duet with Gaelic rapper Griogair Labhruidh! Perhaps not surprisingly, Time Magazine called him one of the three most fun people in show business (the others were Cher and Stanley Tucci!) Thirty years ago his Hamlet stormed the West End and he was hailed as ‘an actor knocking at the door of greatness’. A quarter of a century ago he was a sensation as Cabaret ’s Master of Ceremonies in a production that forever changed the Broadway landscape. A decade ago his visceral, virtually one-man Macbeth was a stunning, transatlantic coup de theatre. His screenwork ranges from art house to blockbuster, cult to the mainstream, but his performances are always indelible and some immortal: “Mr. Floop” in Spy Kids , “Eli” in The Good Wife, Nightcrawler in X2: X Men United, “Sebastian” in The High Life , “O” in Sex and the City , “Boris” in Goldeneye, “King James” in Doctor Who , “Sandy Frink” in Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion , “Mayor Menlove” in Schmigadoon , and himself on Broad City . He is the author of seven books including a New York Times #1 bestselling memoir, performs in concert regularly in halls around the world, and co-owns his own, eponymous cabaret bar Club Cumming, a home for ‘all ages, all genders, all colours, all sexualities, where kindness is all and anything could happen!’ The list of his collaborators over the years includes Liza Minnelli, Jeremy O. Harris, Jackie Chan, the Smurfs, David Bowie, The Simpsons, Robert Wilson, Stanley Kubrick, Jay Z, Bianca Del Rio, the Spice Girls, George Lucas, Terence Blanchard, KT Tunstall and not forgetting Dora the Explorer, Arthur and Elmo. He had a photo exhibition named Alan Cumming Snaps! and an award-winning fragrance named Cumming . He has played Dionysus, the Devil, God, and the Pope and was shot by Herb Ritts for Vanity Fair as Pan. He recently played a 70-year-old woman. He has been a Lee Jeans model and on a stamp. He is a Tony and Olivier award-winning theatre actor. He hosted the Tonys and was nominated for an Emmy for doing so. In fact, he has been nominated for seven Emmys, winning two for his work as the host and producer of The Traitors, along with another New York Emmy, a Scottish BAFTA, and a British Comedy Award. He is an Independent Spirit award-winning producer and National Board of Review-winning director. He is a Grammy and multiple Golden Globe nominee. His portrait was hung in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in the spot previously occupied by the Queen, who made him an O.B.E. (Officer of the British Empire) in her 2009 Honours List for his commitment to LGBT rights. He has four honourary doctorates and over forty awards for being a humanitarian, but as he says, ‘awards mean nothing!’ The 2025 Clio Awards Ceremony Hosted by Alan Cumming Join us as we present Grand Clio, Specialty and “Of the Year” Awards.

That’s about to change. A wave of women’s health brands are rewriting the rules, pushing for more authentic, inclusive storytelling that resonates—and delivers results. The numbers speak for themselves: brands that get it right see up to 10x sales growth, a 43% boost in brand reputation, and a 22% increase in purchase intent. The opportunity for creativity to lead a sea change in the marketplace is massive. Advertisers who break from outdated tropes and embrace real representation will tap into a market demanding better—and they’ll win big. It’s time to stop playing catch-up and start leading the disruption. Moderator: Christine Guilfoyle , President, SeeHer Panelists: Allison Ceraso , Chief Creative Officer, Digitas Health Cara Kamenev , Global Brand President, Stripes Beauty Kim Dolan , Managing Director, Pinterest – GLP-1s Disrupting the Advertising Game Weight loss drugs aren’t just changing bodies—they’re flipping entire industries on their heads. With 1 in 8 adults now on GLP-1s and the market projected to explode to $150 billion by 2033, brands have a shot at reaching a new kind of consumer—one who is eating less, moving more, and rethinking everything from dinner to downtime. As appetite drives a shift in the way people shop, nimble marketers in every category have an opportunity to meet the moment. This panel will dive into the cultural ripple effect of weight loss drugs—and how creative leaders are helping to rebrand, reposition, and redefine what it means to be healthy in 2025. Moderator: Brian Robinson , Global Chief Strategy Officer, Head of Growth & GLP-1 Consultancy Lead, Havas Health Network Panelists: Christina Gutierrez-Williams, Director of Culinary R&D, Daily Harvest Ugur Kucukcetin, Global Pharma Executive (formerly Novartis & Novo Nordisk) Dr. Alexandra Sowa, MD, MA , Physician, Founder of SoWell and Author “The Ozempic Revolution” – Sound That Sticks: How Audio Supercharges Brand Recall in Pharma In a world where attention is fleeting and recall drives prescriptions, sound might be pharma’s secret weapon. Join an expert panel as they dive into the powerful intersection of neuroscience, memory, and audio. This isn’t just theory — it’s a practical look at how pharma brands like Ozempic, Theraflu, and Panadol are using sound to move from passive awareness to active recall. From memory pathways to emotional fluency, our panel will explore why sonic branding is still the most underleveraged tool in pharma marketing — and how the right audio strategy can drive trust, adherence, and long-term behaviour change. Moderator: Roger Sho Gehrmann , Vice President, Integrated Partnerships, MassiveMusic Panelists: Cassandra Sinclair , CEO, VCCP Health Kay Hsu , Head of Global Creative Lab, Spotify – A Very Bridgerton Brand Partnership: How Shondaland Is Using Co-Creation to Help Brands Own The Narrative In a fireside chat with Clio Health Executive Director, Emily Seal, you’ll hear from Shondaland co-presidents Chris DiIorio and Sandie Bailey about how the production company is disrupting the brand partnership arena.
